      This code defines a method called getProviders that fetches a list of manga providers using mangaService.getProviders(). It then subscribes to the result and sets the providers$ property to an observable of the fetched providers. The @returns tag indicates that the method does not return anything (void).\n\n\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        Returns :         void\n\n                    \n                    \n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    \n                        ngOnInit\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n            \n                \nngOnInit()\n                \n            \n\n\n            \n                \n                    Defined in src/app/pages/home/components/providers-cards/providers-cards.component.ts:38\n                \n            \n\n\n            \n                \n                    Life Cicle\n\n\n                    \n                        Returns :         void\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n        Properties\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    \n                        loading$\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Type :     Observable\n\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Default value : of(true)\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        \n                                Defined in src/app/pages/home/components/providers-cards/providers-cards.component.ts:25\n                        \n                    \n\n            \n                \n                    Loading spinner while load the data\n\n                \n            \n\n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    \n                        providers$\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Type :         Observable\n\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Default value : of([])\n                    \n                \n                    \n                        \n                                Defined in src/app/pages/home/components/providers-cards/providers-cards.component.ts:20\n                        \n                    \n\n            \n                \n                    Load Data\n\n                \n            \n\n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        import { of } from 'rxjs/internal/observable/of';\nimport { Observable } from 'rxjs/internal/Observable';\nimport { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\nimport { Router } from '@angular/router';\nimport { ProvidersInterface } from 'src/app/models/providers.model';\nimport { MangaApiService } from 'src/app/services/manga-api.service';\nimport { InitialLoadingService } from 'src/app/services/initial-loading.service';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-providers-cards',\n  templateUrl: './providers-cards.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./providers-cards.component.scss']\n})\nexport class ProvidersCardsComponent implements OnInit {\n\n\n  /**\n   * Load Data\n   */\n  providers$: Observable = of([]);\n\n  /**\n * Loading spinner while load the data\n */\n  loading$: Observable = of(true);\n\n  /**\n   * Class Constructor\n   * \n   * @param mangaService \n   */\n  constructor(private mangaService: MangaApiService,\n    private loadingSvr: InitialLoadingService) { }\n\n  /**\n   * Life Cicle\n   */\n  ngOnInit(): void {\n    this.loading$ = this.loadingSvr.initialLoading$;\n    this.getProviders();\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * This code defines a method called getProviders that fetches a list of manga providers using mangaService.getProviders().
